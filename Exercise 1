# Parameters
n = 10  # Total number of quanta
p = 0.2  # Probability of releasing a quantum

# Function to calculate binomial probability
def binomial_probability(n, k, p):
    # Binomial coefficient
    binom_coeff = math.comb(n, k)
    # Probability of k successes
    prob = binom_coeff * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (n - k))
    return prob

# Calculate and print probabilities for 0 to 10 quanta
probabilities = {}

# Print the results
for k, prob in probabilities.items():

Probability of 2 quanta being released: 0.3020
Probability of 3 quanta being released: 0.2013
Probability of 4 quanta being released: 0.0881
Probability of 5 quanta being released: 0.0264
Probability of 6 quanta being released: 0.0055
